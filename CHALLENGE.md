### Additional Instructions

We don’t want this to take up too much of your time, but we’d like to review something
that represents what you're capable of. Ideally you don't spend more than a couple of
hours on this. Please let us know the types of things you'd do if you had more time and
let us know how you’d consider tackling these.

Also, if there are any higher level concepts that you’d want to implement if this was “for
real” please let us know.
